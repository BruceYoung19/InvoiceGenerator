# InvoiceGenerator

## Hypthoesis:
A modular program, that is able to support the infrastructure of a personal business. This will be able to function for any person, as long as anyone has knowledge of the computer. 

## Description:
The program must be functioning on any computer where this be mac OS, Windows, or Linux. This program must produce more than one technical report and invoice at one time.  

## Analysis:
The program can function and create more than one technical report. However, this is not realistic for a personal business in the modular sense as it requires the use of NetBeans. This will require someone, who has prior knowledge of how to code.  


## Conclusion:
Realistically this program is not feasible by any means as this requires so manual work before all the invoices and reports are generated.
